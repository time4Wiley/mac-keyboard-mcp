# Key Code Corrections

Based on the keyboard image analysis, the following corrections were made:

## Fixed Key Codes

### Function Keys
- **F7**: Changed from 131 → 98
- **F8**: Changed from 109 → 100  
- **F9**: Remains 101
- **F10**: Changed from 100 → 109
- **F17**: Changed from 64 → 160 (was missing!)
- **F18**: Changed from 79 → 131

### Summary of Changes
1. F7 and F8 had incorrect codes
2. F10 and F8 were swapped
3. F17 (code 160) was completely missing from our database
4. F18 had the wrong code

## Verification
The keyboard image clearly shows:
- Key code 160 exists and is mapped to F17
- Key code 98 is F7 (not 131)
- Key code 131 is F18 (not F7)

## Updated Database
All changes have been applied to:
- `/src/keycode/database.rs` - Rust implementation
- `/analysis/keycodes_manual.json` - JSON reference

Total unique key codes: 100+
Key code range: 0-160
